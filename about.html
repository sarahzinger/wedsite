		<h2>Aaron and Sarah</h2>
		<b>April 10th, 2011</b> 
		<br>We met the same way all true nerds meet--with the help of a good algorithm. Thanks to OkCupid, we arranged to meet at the Metro Diner on the Upper West Side to enjoy some brunch and went on to explore a comic book festival downtown. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> Summer, 2011 </b>
		<br> Sarah decided that it would be a good idea to teach tennis and reading to youngsters in Boston for the summer. Aaron decides to visit and doesn't end up leaving till a month later. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>September, 2011</b>
		<br> After accidentally living together in Boston's smallest room imaginable, Aaron and Sarah decide to share a slightly larger studio in Harlem. Together they build many happy memories despite a leaky ceiling, rat-infested walls, and loud neighbors. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Spring and Summer 2012</b>
		<br> Aaron gets his current job at Medidata and Sarah graduates from Hunter. We decided to book it for Brooklyn for a smaller but more functional apartment in Fort Greene with a great view. Sarah also gets her first real job.
		<br>
		<br> 
		<b>2012-2014</b>
		<br> Sarah tries a few different social work jobs before realizing that she'd rather be a programmer like Aaron. Aaron graciously tries to teach Sarah everything he knows. In the meantime, we decide to start a new organization called Americans Give in a vain attempt to save the world, which becomes one of many side projects we hope to accomplish together. We also begin to review Star Trek on a weekly basis, much to the chagrin of everyone's facebook newsfeeds.
		<br>
		<br> 
		<b>Summer 2014</b>
		<br>
		Shortly before her 26th birthday, Aaron proposed to Sarah during one of their weekly Star Trek reviews. The ring, a ruby, stands as a reminder of the computer programming language Aaron has been teaching Sarah in their free time. #nerds.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>September 5, 2015</b>
		<br>
		We get married! 0th wedding anniversary.
