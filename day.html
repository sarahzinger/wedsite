	<div id = "day" class = "text">
		<h2>What's the day going to be like?</h2>
		We hope to have a brief, secular, and fun ceremony. Aaron's brother, Benjamin will be our officiant, and we hope to have our friends and family members in attendance to lend their support, wisdom, and kind words. We've decided not to have attendants for our ceremony, but we do have many amazing people helping in a variety of capacities behind the scenes who we will be sure to give a big shout out to the day of. 
		<br>
		<br> Overall, we wish to put together a day which both celebrates our relationship, as well as the communities that have raised us, with an emphasis on our common shared values. For our reception, expect good food, good company, and more than a handful of fun games.
		<br>
		
		<h2>Where is it?</h2>
		We searched high and low for a venue that matched our nontraditionalist spirits and could fit at least a good portion of our friends and family members. In the end we decided on <a href = "http://bathaus.tumblr.com">Bat Haus</a> in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Conveniently located less than a block away from the L train, Bat Haus is just a hop, skip, and jump away from Manhattan, and is surrounded by some of Brooklyn's finest street art.

		<h2>What should I wear?</h2>
		We're hoping to have a low key, casual, and fun wedding day, so feel free to come as you are with whatever's already hanging out in your wardrobe. 
		<br>
		
		<h2>Do I get a plus one? Are my kiddos invited?</h2>
		We both come from large, loving families, so bringing our guestlist down to 115 people was tough! We tried our best to keep things intimate, while still honoring all of the amazing people who have cared for us over the years. If you look at your Save the Date/Invitation's addressed to section it should say the names of those who are specifically invited. If you have any questions or concerns shoot us an email and we'll try to clarify!

		<h2>I want to buy you something!</h2>
		 Wow, thanks! We feel super fortunate to already have most of the necessities we need in life, so we're actually not going to have a traditional registry. We are genuinely excited to simply have your presence rather than your presents! 
		 <br>
		 <br> That said, we'd feel honored to have money given to the charity of your choice in our names. Some of our current favorites are <a href ="http://givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href ="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>. We're also considering putting together an alternative registry that would allow for non-financial gifts or alternative gifts. If we decide to do so we'll be sure to post it here.
		<br>
		<br>
		We hope to see you in September!
