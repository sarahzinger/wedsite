	<div id = "day" class = "text">
		<h2>What's the day going to be like?</h2>
		We hope to have a brief, secular, and fun ceremony. Aaron's brother, Benjamin will be our officiant, and we hope to have our friends and family members in attendance to lend their support, wisdom, and kind words. We've decided not to have attendants for our ceremony, but we do have many amazing people helping to make this day possible, for whom we are incredibly grateful. 
		<br>
		<br> Overall, we wish to put together a day which both celebrates our relationship, as well as the communities that have raised us, with an emphasis on our common shared values. For our reception, expect good food, good company, and more than a handful of fun games.
		<br>
		
		<h2>Where is it?</h2>
		We searched high and low for a venue that matched our nontraditionalist spirits and could fit at least a good portion of our friends and family members. In the end we decided on <a href = "http://www.bathaus.com/rentals.html">Bat Haus</a> in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Conveniently located less than a block away from the L train, Bat Haus is just a hop, skip, and jump away from Manhattan, and is surrounded by some of Brooklyn's <a href= "http://www.yelp.com/biz/bushwick-collective-street-art-new-york">finest street art</a>.

		<h2>What should I wear?</h2>
		We're hoping to have a low key, casual, and fun wedding day, so feel free to come as you are with whatever's already hanging out in your wardrobe. 
		<br>

		<h2>What's the parking situation?</h2>
		New York City and parking rarely go well together. We would highly recommend taking the subway or a taxi, though there is some street parking available. As the event gets closer, we'll try to get the inside scoop on parking.
		<br>
		
		<h2>Do I get a plus one? Are children invited?</h2>
		We both come from large, loving families, so bringing our guestlist down was tough! We tried our best to keep things intimate, while still honoring all of the amazing people who have cared for us over the years. If you look closely at your Save the Dates and Invitations, it should say the names of those specifically invited. If you have any questions or concerns shoot us an email and we'll try to clarify!

		<h2>I want to buy you something!</h2>
		 Wow, thanks! We feel super fortunate to already have most of the necessities we need in life, so we're actually not going to have a traditional registry. <b> We are genuinely excited to simply have your presence rather than your presents! </b>
		 <br>
		 <br> As always, we would feel honored to have any amount of money given to the charity of your choice in our names. Some of our current favorites are <a href ="http://givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href ="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>. We're also considering putting together an alternative registry that would allow for non-financial gifts. If we decide to do so we'll be sure to post it here.
		<br>
		<br>
		We hope to see you in September!
