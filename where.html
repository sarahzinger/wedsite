		<h2>Places to Stay</h2>
		Since New York has so many great options for places to stay, we've decided not to block out rooms in a hotel. Instead, we'll try to put some options here with a range of prices and experiences. Feel free to do your own research however and find a place that best matches your needs!
		
		<a href = "https://www.airbnb.com/s/Brooklyn--New-York--NY"><h3>Airbnb</h3></a>
		For our tech saavy out of town guests, we'd recommend using Airbnb. Airbnb allows individuals to find spare rooms, full apartments, and unique bed and breakfasts for a wide range of prices. For best results, try to pick users who already have great reviews. With a little bit of digging it's often possible to find entire apartments for very reasonable prices. For the best deal partner up with another guest or two and split the price of a larger apartment! Almost any neighborhood you pick should be a short taxi drive away, but Williamsburg, the East Village, Union Square, the Flatiron District, Stuvesant Town, the West Village, and Chelsea are all fairly close to the "L" train. To check out how far something is by public transit we would recommend google maps and <a href = "https://newyork.hopstop.com/search?xfr=cityscape">Hop Stop</a>

		<h3>Hotels</h3>
		To find deals on hotels, you can also try using priceline, kayak, or hotwire. Since we've never stayed in a hotel in Brooklyn, we have a hard time recommending a place but here are a few that are well reviewed and are easily accessible to ceremony/reception.
		<br>
		<h4>In Brooklyn:</h4>
		<a href = "http://www.hotellejolie.com/">Hotel Le Jolie</a> ~ 
		<a href = "http://wythehotel.com/">Wythe Hotel</a> ~ 
		<a href = "http://akwaaba.com/">Akwaaba Mansion Bed & Breakfast</a> (Akwaaba is not off the L train, but is a short taxi drive away)
		<h4>In Manhattan:</h4>

		<h3>Hostels</h3>
		For those looking for simple and affordable, hostels offer a good option. Again, we've never stayed in these but they are rated well on yelp and are off the L train!
